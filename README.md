# myBuddy
The myBuddy app is a fully functional cross-platform (Android & iOS) mobile application specially designed for the **Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust** Helping Families Team which are a specialist mental health service for families in complex circumstances. It's a buddy system for the clinicians that allows them to keep track of their appointments, ensure their attendance and ensure the safety of the clinicians when they see their patients by having them check in/out at scheduled times, and notify members of the team if they haven't already. The entire app is centered around the objective to provide a seamless experience for the Helping Families Team Members at the NHS.
